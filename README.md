- :telescope: 
I am a software engineer with an educational background in business administration and years of experience in technology sales and recruitment. Throughout my career, I've been fascinated by software development and have actively kept up with the latest technologies and engaged with developers. This led me to explore coding, even in my role as a recruiter, where I found joy in designing mini programs and workflow automations. During my time at App Academy, I fell in love with software development, especially while working on my capstone project. I had the exhilarating experience of cloning Bumble and adding functionalities that I wished existed in the real app.

- :zap: In my free time, I'm a comedian, musician, travel enthusiast, yogi and proud dog mom.
